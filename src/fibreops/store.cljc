(ns fibreops.store
  "SSoT for the fibre-crop-growing operations coordinator, behind a `Store`
  protocol so the backend is a swap, not a rewrite -- the same seam every
  cloud-itonami actor in this fleet uses (mirrors `cerealops.store`,
  cloud-itonami-isic-0111; `tobaccoops.store`, cloud-itonami-isic-0115):

    - `MemStore`     -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for
                        dev/tests/demo (no deps).
    - `DatomicStore` -- backed by `langchain.db`, a Datomic-API-compatible
                        EAV store (datalog q / pull / upsert). Pure `.cljc`,
                        so it runs offline AND can be pointed at a real
                        Datomic Local or a kotoba-server pod by swapping
                        `langchain.db`'s `:db-api` (see langchain.kotoba-db).

  A registered field is the minimal unit of authority: a farm's field must
  be registered before ANY proposal referencing it can be considered by
  the Governor (see `fibreops.governor`'s `field-registered` invariant).
  Field data is opaque to this namespace -- callers/backends decide what a
  field record contains (name, location, crop, acreage, etc); this Store
  only answers \"is this field-id registered, and if so what's on file\".
  Because the field payload shape is intentionally open, `DatomicStore`
  stores it as a single opaque EDN-blob attribute (`:field/payload`, via
  `langchain-store.core`'s `enc`/`dec*`) rather than expanding it into
  per-key Datomic attributes.

  The append-only audit ledger (`ledger`/`append-ledger!`) is this actor's
  core missing plumbing until the deferred-stub fix: `fibreops.operation`'s
  `:commit`/`:hold` graph nodes append every committed/held/
  approval-rejected decision fact here, so a field's operating history
  (every `:log-field-record` / `:schedule-field-operation` /
  `:flag-crop-health-concern` / `:order-supplies` decision) is always a
  query over an immutable log."
