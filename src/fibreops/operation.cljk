(ns fibreops.operation
  "OperationActor -- one fibre-crop-growing operation = one supervised
  actor run, expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The advisor
  (FibreOpsAdvisor) is sealed into a single node (:advise); its proposal
  is ALWAYS routed through the Field Operations Governor (:govern) and
  the rollout phase gate (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore | DatomicStore, see `fibreops.store`)
    - the Advisor  (mock today; real LLM is the next seam --
                     `fibreops.advisor/Advisor` is already the
                     injection point, see its docstring)
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)

  One graph run = one fibre-crop-growing coordination operation. No
  unbounded inner loop -- each operation is auditable and checkpointed.
  A field's operating history is advanced by MANY operations
  (log-field-record / schedule-field-operation / flag-crop-health-
  concern / order-supplies), each its own independent graph run, and
  every commit/hold/approval-rejected decision fact lands in
  `fibreops.store`'s append-only ledger (`store/append-ledger!`), so
  a field's full operating history is always a query over an immutable
  log.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor at the
  `:request-approval` node until a human operator (farmer/agronomist)
  resumes it with a decision. `:flag-crop-health-concern` ALWAYS reaches
  this node when the Governor is clean -- see
  `fibreops.governor/always-escalate-ops`. Mirrors
  `tobaccoops.operation` (cloud-itonami-isic-0115) / `cerealops.operation`
  (cloud-itonami-isic-0111) node/edge structure, wired to this repo's own
  advisor/governor/phase/store.

  FIX (deferred-stub bug): this namespace used to be a plain
  `(let [proposal ... verdict ... disposition ...] {...})` synchronous
  function (`run-operation`) wrapped in a fn masquerading as a compiled
  graph (`build` returned `(fn invoke-operation [request context] ...)`)
  -- it never required `langgraph.graph` at all, despite `deps.edn`
  claiming a real `io.github.kotoba-lang/langgraph` dependency (which
  itself was only reachable from the never-invoked :dev :override-deps
  alias, not the real :deps map -- `:override-deps` overrides an
  *existing* :deps entry, it does not add a new one to an empty :deps
  map). `build` now returns a genuinely compiled
  `langgraph.graph/state-graph`."
